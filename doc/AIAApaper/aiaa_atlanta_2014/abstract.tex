The goal of this paper is to present a verification and validation study of HiFiLES: a high-order LES solver developed in the Aerospace Computing Laboratory (ACL) at Stanford University. HiFiLES has been built on top of SD++ (Castonguay et al.) and achieves high-order spatial discretizations with the Energy-Stable Flux Reconstruction (ESFR) scheme on unstructured grids in two and three dimensions. The high parallelizability of this scheme motivates the solver's ability to run in a multi-GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) environment.
We intend for this paper to be the main reference for HiFiLES and serve (with the previous SD++ papers) as a reference for researchers that would like to develop or implement high-order numerical schemes based on an Energy-Stable Flux Reconstruction (ESFR) approach.
